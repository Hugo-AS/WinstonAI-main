WinstonAI official repository, read README for instructions of use.

To use WinstonAI, in mac, you will need to go to winstonai.org first and download the .zip, then extract it and install the dependencies. In windows, just install the WindowsWinston.py file and Secrets.py file

second you need to create an account on OpenAI and get an API key, once there open the secrets.py file and replace YOUr-API-KEY with your actual api key.

third you open the ai-main.py file with your code editor of preference and run it.

NOTE, a GUI is on its way.

Keep in mind this proyect is just to get familiar with AI and shoudnt be taken as more, it haves its flaws(for example variables that are location dependend, such as: Winston, What time is it?

if everything goes well, this repository should be updated frecuently.
