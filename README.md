# WinstonAI-main
WinstonAI official repository, read README for instructions of use.

To use WinstonAI, you first need to go to winstonai.org to download the code, as github only lets you upload 100 files at a time and this project is over 9k files, so no time to do that.

second you need to create an account on OpenAI and get an API key, once there open the secrets.py file and replace YOUr-API-KEY with your actual api key.

third you open the ai-main.py file with your code editor of preference and run it.

NOTE, a GUI is on its way, aswell as Windows support, however, due to lack of support to C# libraries and my windows computer having issues with python, i cant give an exact date.

Keep in mind this proyect is just to get familiar with AI and shoudnt be taken as more, it haves its flaws(for example variables that are location dependend, such as: Winston, What time is it?

if everytrhing goes well, this repository should be updated frecuently.
